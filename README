Provides bookmarking ability for folders/directories in bash.

To install, put bashmarks.sh somewhere such as ~/bin, then source it 
in your .bashrc file (or other bash startup file):
  source ~/bin/bashmarks.sh

To bookmark a folder, simply go to that folder, then bookmark it like so:
  bm foo

The bookmark will be named "foo"

When you want to get back to that folder use:
  cdb foo

To see a list of the bookmarks:
  bml

To delete a bookmark:
  bmrm foo

Tab completion works, to go to the shoobie folder:
  cdb fo[tab]
  bmrm fo[tab]
